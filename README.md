# Brief

The Security Lock program is an assembly language implementation designed to create a secure access system. It employs a straightforward user authentication mechanism where users input an identification (ID) and a corresponding password. The program, in turn, validates this information against predefined credentials and provides access if the match is successful; otherwise, it displays appropriate error messages.
